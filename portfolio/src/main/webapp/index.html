                <h3>6.08 Introduction to Embedded Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    During the spring semester of my first year at MIT, I enrolled in 6.08 Introduction to Embedded Systems.
                    In this class, I programmed an ESP32 microcontroller in C++ using Arduino libraries. 
                    Throughout the class, multiple input and output devices were added to this microcontroller, including a GPS, a gyroscope and an LCD display. 
                    I also worked with a flask-based server backend and a SQLite database. 

                    This class culminated in a four-week capstone project utilizing the server backend and the ESP32.
                    My team created a virtual world where the user can create an avatar and have it be displayed on the ESP32's display.
                    In addition, players were able to invite up to four other users to their room and view multiple avatars on the screen simultaneously.

                    My main focuses in this project included an authentication system that stored usernames
                    and hashed password data, and integrating the ESP32 frontend and server backend to allow for near real-time updates to each avatar's appearance, animation and location.

                <h2>Acting</h2>
                In addition to my work in computer science, I am an actor. Throughout middle school and high school, I participated in school plays.
                I am currently a member of the Musical Theater Guild at MIT. While I was a cast member in the spring 2020 production of "Cabaret," the production was unfortunately canceled due to COVID-19.
                Professionally, I've appeared as an extra in the upcoming film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321510/">"In The Heights,"</a> and with a speaking role in the 2018 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8669354/">Throwback Holiday</a>. 
                Most notably, I play Nevada Duncan in <a href="https://www.bet.com/shows/carl-webers-the-family-business/">BET's "The Family Business"</a>.

                <p> 
                    The Google walkthrough that I read before making this website was dedicated to a cat named Stanley.
                    Half of my photo gallery is pictures of my cat, Sunday, so I decided to share some pictures.
